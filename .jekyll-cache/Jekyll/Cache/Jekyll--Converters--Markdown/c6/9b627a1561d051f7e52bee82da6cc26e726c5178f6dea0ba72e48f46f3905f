(a multidisciplinary academic programme wherein I learn to write and think critically).</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>I have previously interned at <a href="https://www.axa.com.sg/">AXA Singapore</a>,

<h3 id="why-document-my-learning">Why document my learning?</h3>

<p><strong>To achieve mastery</strong> - To me, the litmus test of oneâ€™s mastery for a complex concept is the
ability to explain said concept simply.
By penning my learning down, I hope to have truly understood what I have learnt.</p>

<p><strong>To share knowledge</strong> - I have always loved how developers helped each other so readily. These articles
are my humble way of contributing to this open-source culture;
I will be delighted if others found the articles helpful in their own pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m always looking to improve. Any feedback is welcomed either via my socials, or directly in the comment section of my articles.</p>
