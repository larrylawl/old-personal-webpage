How to write a great research paper by Simon Peyton Jones from microsoft.

## 1. Don't Wait: Write
Wrong: Idea -> Research -> Write
Correct: Idea -> Write -> Research

## 2. Identify your key idea
Idea: a re-usable insight, useful to the reader.

## 3. Tell a story
1. Here is a problem
2. It's an interesting problem
3. It's an unsolved problem
4. Here is my idea
5. My idea works (details, data)
6. Here's how my idea compares to other people's approaches

Structure
1. Title (1000 readers)
2. Abstract (4 sentences, 100 readers)
3. Intro (1 page, 100 readers)
4. Problem (1 page, 10 readers)
5. My idea (2 pages, 10 readers)
6. Details (5 pages, 3 readers)
7. Related work (1-2 pages, 10 readers)
8. Conclusion (0.5 pages)

## 4. Nail your contributions to the mast

Introduction: 
- Describe the problem 
    - Use example to introduce problem
    - Shift molehills, not mountains
- State your contributions
    - Write contributions first. The list of contributions drives the entire paper.
    - Reader thinks "gosh, if they can really deliver this, that'd be exciting; I better read on"
    - Contributions should be refutable

## 5. Related work: later
No: Abstract -> Intro -> Related work -> Problem -> Idea -> Details -> Conclusion

Yes: Abstract -> Intro -> Problem -> Idea -> Details -> Related work -> Conclusion

Why? 
0. Reader knows nothing about the problem yet
1. Describing alternating approaches gets between the reader and our idea

Giving credit to others does not diminish credit I get from my paper

## 6. Put your readers first
1. Conveying intuition
2. Presenting idea

## 7. Listen to your readers

> DO not respond "you stupid person, I meant X". Lol.
