Having taken both Dr Andrew's Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses, I'm a big fan of Dr Andrew and value his opinions. Thus when I've chanced upon this online lecture of Dr Andrew's advice on "building a career in machine learning", I felt as though I struck gold. While I'd highly recommmend watching the whole lecture, here's a quick summary of what I think is important:

## How to Read Research Papers
1. Compile a list of papers and skip around list
2. Source of papers: twitter, ML subreddit, top conferences, friends

### How to read a Single Paper
Multiple passes of ...
1. Title/abstract/figures
2. Intro + Conclusions + Figures + Skim the rest
3. Read but skip/skim math
4. Whole paper but skip parts that don't make sense

### Questions to keep in mind:
1. What did the authors try to accomplish?
2. What were the key elements of the approach?
3. What can you use yourself?
4. What other references do you want to follow?

### Math
1. Rederive from scratch (allows you to generalise to novel research)

### Code
1. Run open-source code
2. Reimplement from scratch

### Long term advice
1. Consistent readings throughout the year, not short bursts

## Building a Career in ML
### Recruiters look for...
1. Theoretical Skills (ML quiz, coding)
2. Practical applications 
3. T-Shaped knowledge base: first having a broad understanding of AI, before having a very deep understanding in at least one area.
    1. Broad understanding can be developed from: coursework, reading
    2. Deep understanding from: Projects, open-source, research, internship

### How to Select a job
1. Work with great people/projects (not on the "brand" of the company)
2. Apply to both graduate programmes and industry, and pick the best opportunity from there: the line between academia and industry is blurring in AI, thus it's wiser to apply for opportunities in both areas, and pick the best one moving forward

### Long-Term Advice
1. Do important work
2. Learn the most
