### Intro

My name's Larry Law (or Law Ann Liat, Larry), and I'm a computer science junior with a minor in mathematics at the
[National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/),
and a scholar of the [University Scholar's Programme (USP)](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/)
(a multidisciplinary academic programme wherein I learn to write and think critically).

For this winter, I will be continuing my research on **'Integrating Non-Myopic Bayesian Optimisation with Network Morphism for Neural Architecture Search'** under [A/P Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html). 

My **resume** can be viewed [here](/assets/larry_resume.pdf).

### Logs
Similar to how logging records events triggered by processes, this log serves to record milestones in my (professional) life.

```py
NOV_2020 = "Completed my first research experience in autonomous robots! The journey was emotional but definitely the highlight of my sem. Demo can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wqBXBouSusaGnEU_6AFmAhX2-i5Vc1bw/view?usp=sharing. Report can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/zhmjvbsvnbgf. Thanks Yuan Bo for the collaboration!"

NOV_2020 = "Halfway through UROP! Progress was surprisingly more productive in the semester than working on it full time in the summer, which I attribute to consistent communication with Prof Bryan. Interim report can be viewed here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcsmbgwfbphk. Thanks Wey Yeh for the collaboration!"

MAR_2020 = "Completed Dr Andrew's 14 weeks Deep Learning course. Was challenging juggling online courses and school work, but worth it as these courses allowed me to make a more informed decision for my UROP research project."

DEC_2019 = "Completed Dr Andrew's 11 weeks Machine Learning course."

AUG_2019 = "Completed Internship with AXA Singapore. Pretty fun front-end experience."
```

### Why document my learning?

**To achieve mastery** - To me, the litmus test of one's mastery for a complex concept is the
ability to explain said concept simply.
By penning my learning down, I hope to have truly understood what I have learnt.

**To share knowledge** - I have always loved how developers helped each other so readily. These articles
are my humble way of contributing to this open-source culture;
I will be delighted if others found the articles helpful in their own pursuit of knowledge.

### Feedback

I'm always looking to improve. Any feedback is welcomed either via my socials, or directly in the comment section of my articles.
