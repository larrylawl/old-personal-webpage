<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{df(x_1, x_2, ... , x_n)}{dx_1dx_2...dx_n}</script>

<p>The partial derivatives tells us how a small change in all $ x_i $ changes the multivariate function.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-computation-of-partial-derivatives-relate-to-this-interpretation">How does the computation of partial derivatives relate to this interpretation?</h2>

<p>Recall that to compute partial derivatives wrt $ x_i $, we differentiate wrt to our variable of interest, and <em>treat the rest of the variables constant</em>.</p>

<!-- single partial derivative -->

<!-- double partial derivative -->
<p>gradient descent</p>

<p>Recall that a linear transformation <em>moves</em> the vector. The determinant computes the <strong>factor by which the space was changed by this linear transformation</strong> (space := area in $ R_2 $, volume in $ R_3 $).</p>

<p>If the determinant, d, is…</p>

<p>≥0, d changes the space by a factor of d.</p>

<p>≤0, d <em>flips</em> and changes the space by a factor of d.</p>

<p>= 0, d squishes the space to one dimension. Thus the matrix is <em>non-invertible</em>, and hence it is <em>singular</em></p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-work">Why does this work?</h2>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">det(AB) = det(A)det(B)</script>

<p>AB is equivalent to</p>

<ol>
  <li>first applying linear transformation of B, which moves the vector. The factor by which this movement changes space is $ det(B) $.</li>
  <li>then applying linear transformation of A. The factor by which this movement changes space is $ det(A) $.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus determinant of the linear transformation of B then A equals the multiplication of the individual determinant values.</p>
