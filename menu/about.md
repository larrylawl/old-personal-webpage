### Intro

My name's Larry Law (or Law Ann Liat, Larry), and I'm a computer science junior with a minor in mathematics at the
[National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/),
and a scholar of the [University Scholar's Programme (USP)](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/)
(a multidisciplinary academic programme wherein I learn to write and think critically).

For this summer, I will be researching on Neural Architecture Search with Bayesian Optimisation under [Dr Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html). 

### Experience

I have previously interned at [AXA Singapore](https://www.axa.com.sg/),
where I did full stack web development. I have also completed both Dr Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://github.com/larrylawl/machine-learning-coursera-stanford) and [Deep Learning](https://github.com/larrylawl/deep-learning-coursera) courses.

### Why document my learning?

**To achieve mastery** - To me, the litmus test of one's mastery for a complex concept is the
ability to explain said concept simply.
By penning my learning down, I hope to have truly understood what I have learnt.

**To share knowledge** - I have always loved how developers helped each other so readily. These articles
are my humble way of contributing to this open-source culture;
I will be delighted if others found the articles helpful in their own pursuit of knowledge.

### Feedback

I'm always looking to improve. Any feedback is welcomed either via my socials, or directly in the comment section of my articles.
