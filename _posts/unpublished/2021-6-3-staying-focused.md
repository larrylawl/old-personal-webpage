MDProspect's a no-nonsense, straight-to-the-chase kinda youtuber who does what he preaches. I learnt so much from his study technique video previously, and now I'm trying to learn how he stays so focused (as I often catch myself in the alt-tab trap). Here's the top ten tips he rec:

1. Stimulation Curve
2. Visualization of Tasks
3. My Pomodoro Use. Elaboration [here](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#what-makes-pomodoro-so-effective).
4. Recognizing (and adjusting to) Loss of Focus
5. Glamour vs Unkempt Curve
6. Proper Study Mindset
7. Destroy All Distractions
8. Declutter Your Space
9. Invest in a Study Setup
10. Proper (Healthy) Rewards
