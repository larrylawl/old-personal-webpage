# Readings
## 'The White Bird' by John Berg
Questions:
1. What is meant by "this coincidence is two faced?" *(P8-2P)*
2. So... what is aesthetic?

**RQ:** What is aesthetics (in comparison to art), in the context of "the principle of hope and the existence of evil"? 

**Thesis 1:** Qualities of the white bird which provoke an aesthetic emotion:
1. *Figurative* Representation
2. Choice of subject + context renders the object *symbolic*
3. *Respect* for the material used
4. *Formal unity and economy*
5. Provokes a kind of astonishment

> Aesthetic emotion is defined by the intangibles ("figurative", "symbolic", "respect", "Formal unity and economy") as opposed to the tangibles (craftsmanship when compared to van Gogh self-portrait).

**CA1:** "These definitions *reduce aesthetics to art*. They say nothing  about the relation between art and nature, art and the world." *(P7P1)*

**Relation between beauty and nature:** 
1. "It is within this bleak natural context that beauty is encountered, and the encounter is by its nature sudden and unpredictable." *(P7-2P)*
2. "Beauty is always an exception, always in despite of. That is why it moves us." *(P7-1P)*

**Caveat: Beauty is not universal.** "The range of what a given community finds beautiful in nature will depend upon its means of survival, its economy, its geography." *(P8P1)*

**Relation between aesthetic and nature:**
1. "The evolution of natural forms and the evolution of human perception have coincided ..."
2. "The aesthetic emotion before nature derives ... from this double affirmation."

**Relation between aesthetic emotion before man-made object and nature**
1. "The aesthetic emotion we feel before a man-made object is a derivative of the emotion we feel before nature." (P9P20
2. "Art is an organised response to what nature allows us to glimpse occasionally."

## 'What is Art?' by Leo Tolstoy

**Thesis 1:** "Art begins when one person, with the object of joining another or others to himself in one and the same feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications."

This emotion can also be described as a "spiritual union," (#26) (or resonance as described by `YingFeng`) which is also mentioned in Renan's text.

**Assumption of Thesis 1:** 
1. "The activity of art is based on the fact that a man, receiving through his sense of hearing or sight another man's expression of feeling, is capable of experiencing the emotion which moved the man who expressed it."
2. "Speech is a transmission of thoughts, while art is a transmission of emotions"

> External Indications: stories, drama, pictures etc

**Art is not...**
1. A means to *pleasure* (prevalent view of today)
2. Direct or immediate infection (eg yawning)
3. Manifestation of beauty, game, emotions

**CA:** Some teachers of mankind (such as Pluto) repudiate art. They view art as so highly dangerous in its power to infect people against their wills that mankind will lose far less by banishing all art than by tolerating each and every art.

**CCA:** Art is an indispensable means of communication, without which mankind could not exist.

**RQ2:** Distinguish art from counterfeit art.

**Thesis 2:** The infectiousness of art. "The chief peculiarity of this feeling is that the receiver of a true artistic impression is so united to the artist that he feels as if the work were his own and not someone else's - as if what it expresses were just what he had long been wishing to express."

The stronger the infection, the better is the art.

Degree of such infection depends on:
1. **Individuality:** Tailoured to the individual reader
2. **Clearness:** "[the reader] has long known and 3felt, and for which he has only now found expression."
3. Most importantly, **Sincerity in the artist:** "the reader feels that the artist is infected by his own production, and writes ... for *himself*, and *not merely to act on others*, this mental condition of the artist infects the receiver.

> If you have 3), you'll have 1) and 2).

> However, Tolstoy tends to make sweeping claims which become vague (ie "sincerity" or even "clearness"). He doe so because he wants his theory to serve a wide range of artworks. (Evidence: Prof's prep tips for Tolstoy)

**Intended Audience:** Bourgeoisie. 

> #35:"(Sincerity) is always complied with in peasant art, and this explains why such art acts so powerfully; but it is a condition almost entirely absent from **our** upper-class art, which is continually produced by artists actuated by personal aims of covetousness (greed) or vanity."

Tolstoy's criticism of the upper-class art, as opposed to "peasant" art - art that is drawn by the common folk or art that depicts the life of common folk. `Merilynn`

> #14: "... or like Kasper Houser."

Usage of **Kasper Houser**, a character which likely only the literate know about (since there's no google yet...). Kasper was not raised by humans, thus he's described as feral (wild state). 

## 'What is a Nation?' by Ernest Renan

**Research Question:** "But on what criterion should we base this national right (nation)? By what sign shall we know it? From what tangible fact can we derive it?"

**By Race:**
1. There are no pure races.
2. Race is diminishing in importance: "Aside from anthropological traits there is reason, justice, truth, and beauty, things that are the same for all." 

**By Language:**
1. Counter examples:
   1. "The United States and England, like Spanish America and Spain, speak the same language but do not constitute a single nation."
   2. By contrast, Switzerland, so well-made because created by the consent of its different parts, contains three or four languages. The desire of Switzerland to be united despite its linguistic variety is a much more important fact than similarity often achieved by humiliation. This hints at the importance of **liberty (over coersion) (daily plebiscite)** as to what constitutes a nation. 
2. Diminishing importance.

**By Religion:**
1. "There are no longer masses of people believing in a uniform manner." 
2. "Religion has become something individual and concerns the conscience of each"

**By Community of Interest**
1. Communities of interest determine commercial treaties

**By Geography**
1. Geography is too arbitrary a factor to categorise nations.
2. "Geography provides the substratum, the field of battle and of work but man provides the soul." 

**So what is a nation?**
1. **A Nation is a soul, a spiritual principle:** "One is the past, the other is the present. One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is present consent, the desire to live together, the desire to continue to invest in the heritage that we have jointly received."
2. **Solidarity**
3. **Consent:** "For us, a province is its inhabitants
and, if anyone in this affair has the right to be consulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never has a true interest in annexing or holding territory that does not wish to be annexed or held."

> Notice that Renan specifically stated that a nation is 1) a "daily plebiscite" and 2) "spiritual principle." What is the difference between the two?

1. **Plebiscite:** Direct vote form individuals, which is the accumulation of differing opinions
2. **Spiritual Principle:** Everyone agrees to this principle

Further notice how this relate to the quote of "actions who are positioned at the intersection of multiple temporal contexts can develop greater capacities for creative and critical intervention" - actors being us!

# Lessons
## Lesson 5
> Painting is the result of the receptivity of the ink. The ink is open to the brush. The brush is open to the heart. All this in the same way as the sky engenders what the earth produces. Everything is the result of receptivity. - Shitao

To me, this is related to Renan's reading, wherein he focused on liberty rather than coersion.

> When once the principle of collaboration has been understood, it becomes a criterion for judging works of any style... Or rather (because judgement has little do with art) it offers us an insight... -Berger

### Mini Lecture: Gellner: Three Stages
**Learning Outcomes**
1. Three stages of social development (how we got to nationalism)
2. Description of the third stage: modern bureaucratic nationalism
3. Criticisms of his theory

**Stage One: hunter-gatherer**

**Stage two: agro-literate**
> Agroliterate: Designating a polity or social system in which the majority of people are peasant agricultural producers, controlled by a small elite to whom literacy is largely restricted; of or relating to such a polity or system.

1. People didn't travel much and far.

**Stage three: industrial modernity**

1. People who had been peasants started moving.
   1. In Berner's perspective, he stated that the peasants might not have had a better life in the city.

**Becoming a cog**
1. History
2. Motivation
   1. They are kicked out of the land they were once employed in.
3. Mechanism
   1. People, who have limited literacy and only agricultural skills, are not prepared for industrial modernity are thrusted into it.
   2. Common language to communicate these skills. Once the work gets mechanical, it's better to have a common tongue.
   3. Language may be the criterion of nationhood 
4. Result: nationalism

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. Don't include qns within teaching stint as it may detrack your planned schedule
2. History vs Legend: History is about evidence, whereas legend is less falsfiable
3. **Benjamin Walter:** art has an aura (thus people go to the artwork itself, as opposed to seeing it through a screen)
4. **Prise apart** analysis of art

## Lesson 4, 29/01:
**Prep Tips**
> How close Renan (R) and Tolstoy (T) were temporally?

1. R: March 11th, 1882
2. T: 1896.

> How similarly they framed their projects: "what is x?" including "what is not x, that some people mistake for x?"

1. R: Nation is a soul, a spiritual principle. Nation is not race, religion, community of interest, geography.
2. T: Art is an expression of emotion. Art is not direct (#6), manifestation of some mysterious idea of beauty or god (#12), not pleasure.

> The oddity that both discussed 'spiritual union'
1. "Spiritual" suggests that the union is hard to describe, yet convincing.

> when I asked you about the ins and outs of reading up on the artist, did any of you think about Tolstoy being a literary artist?  If not, why not?  If so, how so?  Putting this thought-prod differently, do you come to the same decision about reading up on, or not reading up on, if you view the person in question as a theorist rather than an artist?

No I did not, the article wrote about theories explicitly, so I thought he was a theorist. There is a higher probability that I read up the person in question if he is an artist. This is because art is often subjective and open to interpretation, thus in order to gather more information on the art piece at work, my curiousity will steer me to read up on the artist.

> "The brush ... is for saving things from chaos."

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. Point of the mini quiz: How did you make the decision to read up Houster? If you didn't understand Houster and yet you skimmed by it, the decision to do so highlights something problematic.
2. **Pagan:** a person holding religious beliefs other than those of the main world religions. Often used as a "diss" word. 
3. I learnt how as a teacher you should listen to the opinions of your students, even if the opinions steer your lesson plan off track. And thank your students!
4. "Theory" of art in the "FASS" way: theories are falsifiable (~= testability) hypothesis; likewise, thesis should be falsifiable as well
1. "Struggling" on...
   1. "Feeling of hopeless dependency"

## Lesson 3, 22/01: 
**Prep Tips**

[Duchamps' Fountain](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-duchamps-urinal-changed-art-forever)
1.  The idea at hand, of art primarily as a concept rather than an object, is what would make Fountain arguably the most intellectually captivating and challenging art piece of the 20th century.
2.  What is a work of art? Who gets to decide, the artist or the critic? Can a work derive from an idea alone or does it require the hand of a maker?

**Intersection between Tolstoy and Renan**
1. **Everyday:** (?) & daily plebsicite
2. **Unity:** "Unity of mankind" & "spiritual principle"
3. **Nothing to resist:** Sincerity & Voalition

**The potter's flaw**
- Using gold or striking colours to accentuate the cracks
- Eg of art moving into mental health discussions

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. **Art is explicitly vague:** Sara stated that “every interpretation (of art) is personal yet universal.” Perhaps art is left intentionally vague to connect with the general audience, while leaving room for individual interpretation, thus collectively achieving this “personal yet universal” effect.
2. **Secularisation Thesis**
   1. World is increasingly secular
   2. Religion retreats to the private domain

## Lesson 2, 17/01: Discussion of 'What is a Nation' by Ernest Renan
> "Real Drawing is a constant question, is a clumsiness, which is a form of hospitality (openness) towards what is being drawn."

> "Actors who are positioned at the intersection of multiple temporal-relational contexts can develop greater capacities for creative and critical intervention." 

*Abstraction* (from contexts) is the operation done in develop greater capacities.

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. **Use "argues/says" instead of "believe":** "say" ≠ "believe", for I may not say what I fully believe.
2. **Usage of "like" as a filler word**: Don't, for the word has a purpose (eg comparision).
3. **Minutiae**: A collection of very specific things (Adjective is "minute" (very small)) 
4. **Orientalist vs Orientalism:** Knowledge of the East vs derogatory attitude towards the East

**Learn to recognise biases:** For eg from Rener's reading,
1. He doesn't know much about China - 
2. Attacking organised religion - He wrote the 5th gospel
3. He is anti Germany

## Lesson 1, 15/01: Introduction

**In one word, what is the skill (≠ content) this module is trying to teach?** Testing theory application (since theory is usually not applied to SG)

**Types of nationalism**
1. Primordial - natural, organic, indisputable, posited
2. Invented
3. Imagined

**Difference between Nation and State:**
In political science, a "*nation*" refers to a group of people who feel bound into a single body by shared culture, values, folkways, religion and/or language. A "*state*" just refers to a patch of land with a sovereign government.

> What is a nation-state?

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. Posits: put forward as *fact* (stems from the root word of deposit)
2. Gemeinshaft: (mein means) opinion
3. Gesellshaft: Artificial, machine-like construct
4. Orientalism: Perception that the East is backward, and inferior of the West.
