## What is this?

Documenting my love of learning, one byte at a time. More concretely, I write about 
1. Byte-sized articles about machine learning, math, or any cool stuff I happen to learn
2. Notes for school or online courses.

## Why do this?
**To achieve mastery -** To me, the litmus test of oneâ€™s mastery for a complex concept is the ability to explain said concept simply. By penning my learning down, I hope to have truly understood what I have learnt.

**To share knowledge -** I have always loved how developers helped each other so readily. These articles are my humble way of contributing to this open-source culture; I will be delighted if others found the articles helpful in their own pursuit of knowledge.

## Comments?
Always welcomed, either via my socials or directly in the comment section of my articles.
