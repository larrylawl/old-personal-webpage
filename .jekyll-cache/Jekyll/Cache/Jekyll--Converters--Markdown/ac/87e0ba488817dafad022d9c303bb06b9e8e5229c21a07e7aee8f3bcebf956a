<p>The input vector, v, is _ linearly transformed_ from being represented by the basis vectors in A, to the basis vectors ihat and jhat.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-linear-transformation">Parsing Linear Transformation</h2>

<p>Transformation: A function that takes in an input vector and <em>moves</em> it.
Linear: The <em>movement</em> described above is linear if and only if</p>

<ol>
  <li>the origin remains</li>
  <li>lines stay as lines. (In other words, the set of vectors that have the same span remains the same after the transformation)</li>
</ol>

<p>Without loss of generality to <script type="math/tex">R_n</script>, lets consider <script type="math/tex">R_2</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">T(v) := Av, where A</script>

<p>A has the basis vector ihat and jhat. Suppose that ihat and jhat lie on different span, these vectors can represent any vector in <script type="math/tex">R_2</script>.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to multiply the coefficient matrix A with input vector?</p>

<p>The input vector, v, is _ linearly transformed_ from being represented by the basis vectors in A, to the basis vectors ihat and jhat.</p>

<p>Av = (â€¦)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Note: If the coefficient matrix lies on the same span, then it will transform the input vector to <script type="math/tex">R_1</script>.)</p>
