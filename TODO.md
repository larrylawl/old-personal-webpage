## Articles
- [ ] Understand `figmincg` and `fminunc`
- [ ] learning curves
  - independent of no of features (so u nn plot the feature graph)
  - function of **trg set** (not cv set) --> See how theta learns based on i (and not m) of them --> Thus u apply the cost function based on the set of i trg samples, and the cost function based on thes et of all m cv samples.
    - Compare the cost function that the model learnt from (which is over i trg samples), with the cost function that shows the accurate cost of the current theta on new examples (which is over all m cv samples)
  - Diagnose variance or bias or both
  - High bias
    - Both cross validation and training has high error, but they converge

## Refactoring
