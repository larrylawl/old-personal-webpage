<h2 id="interpretation-of-partial-derivatives-wrt-single-variable">Interpretation of partial derivatives wrt single variable</h2>
<p>Recall that derivatives tell us how a small change in x changes f(x).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{df(x)}{dx}</script>

<p>Similarly in the multivariate world, the partial derivative below tells us how a small change in $ x_1 $ changes the multivariate function.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{df(x_1, x_2)}{dx_1}</script>

<p>In other words, we are interested in the derivative of the red line below for a fixed value of $ x_2 $.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/partial-derivative-sv.jpg" alt="Geometric interpretation of partial derivative of a single variable" /></p>

<p>Note that the partial derivative of a function of $ x_1 $ is still a function of $ x_1 $. This function outputs the gradient of the multivariate function with respect to $ x_1 $, and with $ x_2 $ held constant.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation-of-partial-derivatives-wrt-multiple-variables">Interpretation of partial derivatives wrt multiple variables</h2>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{df(x_1, x_2, ... , x_n)}{dx_1dx_2...dx_n}</script>

<p>Similarly, the partial derivatives wrt multiple variables tells us how a small change in all $ x_i $ changes the multivariate function. It is a function of all $ x_i $ that outputs the gradient of the multivariate function with respect to all $ x_i $. In $ R_3 $, this is the gradient of any surface we see.</p>

<h2 id="computation-of-partial-derivatives-wrt-multiple-variables">Computation of partial derivatives wrt multiple variables</h2>
<p>Recall that to compute partial derivatives wrt $ x_i $, we differentiate wrt to our variable of interest, and <em>treat the rest of the variables constant</em>. We iteratively repeat the partial differentiation until all variables have been partially differentiated. But can <em>treating the rest of the variables constant</em> allow us to arrive at the interpretation we have above?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To reconcile the computation with the interpretation, I like to think of each partial differentiation computation as an <em>expression.</em></p>

  <li>$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} $ describes how a small change in $ x_1 $ changes $ f $.</li>
  <li>$ \frac{1}{\partial x_2} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} $ describes how a small change in $ x_2 $ changes $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} $, which itself captures how a small change in $ x_1 $ changes $ f $. Thus the expression as a whole describes how a small change in $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ changes $ f $.</li>
  <li>Repeat until $ x_n $</li>
