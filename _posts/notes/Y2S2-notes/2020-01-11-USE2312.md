# Readings
## 'What is Art?' by Leo Tolstoy

**Thesis 1:** "Art begins when one person, with the object of joining another or others to himself in one and the same feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications."

**Assumption of Thesis 1:** 
1. "The activity of art is based on the fact that a man, receiving through his sense of hearing or sight another man's expression of feeling, is capable of experiencing the emotion which moved the man who expressed it."
2. "Speech is a transmission of thoughts, while art is a transmission of emotions"

> External Indications: stories, drama, pictures etc

**Art is not...**
1. A means to *pleasure* (prevalent view of today)
2. Direct or immediate infection (eg yawning)
3. Manifestation of beauty, game, emotions

**CA:** Some teachers of mankind (such as Pluto) repudiate art. They view art as so highly dangerous in its power to infect people against their wills that mankind will lose far less by banishing all art than by tolerating each and every art.

**CCA:** Art is an indispensable means of communication, without which mankind could not exist.

**RQ2:** Distinguish art from counterfeit art.

**Thesis 2:** The infectiousness of art. "The chief peculiarity of this feeling is that the receiver of a true artistic impression is so united to the artist that he feels as if the work were his own and not someone else's - as if what it expresses were just what he had long been wishing to express."

The stronger the infection, the better is the art.

Degree of such infection depends on:
1. **Individuality:** Tailoured to the individual reader
2. **Clearness:** "[the reader] has long known and 3felt, and for which he has only now found expression."
3. Most importantly, **Sincerity in the artist:** "the reader feels that the artist is infected by his own production, and writes ... for *himself*, and *not merely to act on others*, this mental condition of the artist infects the receiver.

> If you have 3), you'll have 1) and 2).

## 'What is a Nation?' by Ernest Renan

**Research Question:** "But on what criterion should we base this national right (nation)? By what sign shall we know it? From what tangible fact can we derive it?"

**By Race:**
1. There are no pure races.
2. Race is diminishing in importance: "Aside from anthropological traits there is reason, justice, truth, and beauty, things that are the same for all." 

**By Language:**
1. Counter examples:
   1. "The United States and England, like Spanish America and Spain, speak the same language but do not constitute a single nation."
   2. By contrast, Switzerland, so well-made because created by the consent of its different parts, contains three or four languages. The desire of Switzerland to be united despite its linguistic variety is a much more important fact than similarity often achieved by humiliation. This hints at the importance of **liberty (over coersion) (daily plebiscite)** as to what constitutes a nation. 
2. Diminishing importance.

**By Religion:**
1. "There are no longer masses of people believing in a uniform manner." 
2. "Religion has become something individual and concerns the conscience of each"

**By Community of Interest**
1. Communities of interest determine commercial treaties

**By Geography**
1. Geography is too arbitrary a factor to categorise nations.
2. "Geography provides the substratum, the field of battle and of work but man provides the soul." 

**So what is a nation?**
1. **A Nation is a soul, a spiritual principle:** "One is the past, the other is the present. One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is present consent, the desire to live together, the desire to continue to invest in the heritage that we have jointly received."
2. **Solidarity**
3. **Consent:** "For us, a province is its inhabitants
and, if anyone in this affair has the right to be consulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never has a true interest in annexing or holding territory that does not wish to be annexed or held."

> Notice that Renan specifically stated that a nation is 1) a "daily plebiscite" and 2) "spiritual principle." What is the difference between the two?

1. **Plebiscite:** Direct vote form individuals, which is the accumulation of differing opinions
2. **Spiritual Principle:** Everyone agrees to this principle

Further notice how this relate to the quote of "actions who are positioned at the intersection of multiple temporal contexts can develop greater capacities for creative and critical intervention" - actors being us!

# Lessons
## Lesson 3, 22/01: 
**Prep Tips**

[Duchamps' Fountain](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-duchamps-urinal-changed-art-forever)
1.  The idea at hand, of art primarily as a concept rather than an object, is what would make Fountain arguably the most intellectually captivating and challenging art piece of the 20th century.
2.  What is a work of art? Who gets to decide, the artist or the critic? Can a work derive from an idea alone or does it require the hand of a maker?

**Intersection between Tolstoy and Renan**
1. **Everyday:** (?) & daily plebsicite
2. **Unity:** "Unity of mankind" & "spiritual principle"
3. **Nothing to resist:** Sincerity & Voalition

**The potter's flaw**
- Using gold or striking colours to accentuate the cracks
- Eg of art moving into mental health discussions

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. **Art is explicitly vague:** Sara stated that “every interpretation (of art) is personal yet universal.” Perhaps art is left intentionally vague to connect with the general audience, while leaving room for individual interpretation, thus collectively achieving this “personal yet universal” effect.
2. **Secularisation Thesis**
   1. World is increasingly secular
   2. Religion retreats to the private domain

## Lesson 2, 17/01: Discussion of 'What is a Nation' by Ernest Renan
> "Real Drawing is a constant question, is a clumsiness, which is a form of hospitality (openness) towards what is being drawn."

> "Actors who are positioned at the intersection of multiple temporal-relational contexts can develop greater capacities for creative and critical intervention." 

*Abstraction* (from contexts) is the operation done in develop greater capacities.

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. **Use "argues/says" instead of "believe":** "say" ≠ "believe", for I may not say what I fully believe.
2. **Usage of "like" as a filler word**: Don't, for the word has a purpose (eg comparision).
3. **Minutiae**: A collection of very specific things (Adjective is "minute" (very small)) 
4. **Orientalist vs Orientalism:** Knowledge of the East vs derogatory attitude towards the East

**Learn to recognise biases:** For eg from Rener's reading,
1. He doesn't know much about China - 
2. Attacking organised religion - He wrote the 5th gospel
3. He is anti Germany

## Lesson 1, 15/01: Introduction

**In one word, what is the skill (≠ content) this module is trying to teach?** Testing theory application (since theory is usually not applied to SG)

**Types of nationalism**
1. Primordial - natural, organic, indisputable, posited
2. Invented
3. Imagined

**Difference between Nation and State:**
In political science, a "*nation*" refers to a group of people who feel bound into a single body by shared culture, values, folkways, religion and/or language. A "*state*" just refers to a patch of land with a sovereign government.

> What is a nation-state?

**Random bits of knowledge**
1. Posits: put forward as *fact* (stems from the root word of deposit)
2. Gemeinshaft: (mein means) opinion
3. Gesellshaft: Artificial, machine-like construct
4. Orientalism: Perception that the East is backward, and inferior of the West.
