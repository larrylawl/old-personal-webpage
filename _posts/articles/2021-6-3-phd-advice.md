Repository of Grad School advice as inspired by [Prof Jason Hong](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/advice.html). **My favorites are highlighted in bold.**

## Applying to Grad School
> What is expected of me in grad school? How do I find an advisor?

[**Applying to Ph.D. Programs in CS**](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)  by Mor Harchol-Balter. Great factual resource on what's needed and what's looked out for.

[A Survival Guide to a PHD](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/) by Andrej Karpathy. Liked his section on "research topics", which challenged me to truly work on meaningful problems. But is it too hard a starting point?

[How to Be a Successful PhD Student](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~wallach/how_to_be_a_successful_phd_student.pdf) by Mark Dredze (JHU) and Hanna (University of Massachusetts Amherst). Emphasised on the relationship with my advisor - to **listen**, ping, meet, and ask for feedback.

## Learning How to do Research
> What exactly is research? How do I select research problems? How do I do good research?

[**You and Your Research**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) by Richard Hamming. Layers my thinking of *important problems*, *hard work*, and *collaboration*.

> *"You can't work on important problems all the time... you have to plant little acrons which grow into mighty oak trees."*

> *"The guy who works hardest doesn't win. The person who works on the right problem at the right time in the right way is what counts."*

>*"The guy with the door closed were often very well able, very gifted, but they seem to work always on slightly the wrong problem. You'll (need) to get a wide feeling of what is going on."*

>*"The importance of a problem to a great extent depends upon have you got a way of attacking the problem."*

> *Tolerance of ambiguity. Great scientists believe the theory enough so that they continue working. But they just believed enough to to notice what's wrong and make the big change to the new theory.*


[How to Write a Great Research Paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-to-write-a-great-research-paper.pdf) by Simon Peyton Jones. Having been taught many frameworks for writing, Simon's seems the most general and exciting.
