<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>I am a computer science sophomore at the
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/">National University of Singapore</a>,
and a scholar of the <a href="http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/">University Scholarâ€™s Programme</a>
(a multidisciplinary academic programme wherein I learn to write and think critically).</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>I have previously interned at <a href="https://www.axa.com.sg/">AXA Singapore</a>,
where I did full stack web development.
Details of my professional experience can be found in my <a href="/assets/LarryResume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-document-my-learning">Why document my learning?</h3>

<p><strong>To achieve mastery</strong> - To me, the litmus test of oneâ€™s mastery for a complex concept is the
ability to explain said concept simply.
By penning my learning down, I hope to have truly understood what I have learnt.</p>

<p><strong>To share knowledge</strong> - I have always loved how developers helped each other so readily. These articles
are my humble way of contributing to this open-source culture;
I will be delighted if others found the articles helpful in their own pursuit of knowledge.</p>
