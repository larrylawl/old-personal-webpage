## Context
Unlike high school, undergraduates need to plan our own semester. Thus, a question I often receive as a senior is: "Here's my mods for sem _i_. Will my workload be too heavy if I add in mod _j_?"

Unfortunately, it is hard for me to answer this question as everyone has different capacities. A semester that is too heavy for me might be too light for someone else.

Instead, I would advise him to _estimate his own capacity_, and judge for himself if he shud add mod _j_.

## Algorithm to Estimate Workload
- Allocate each commitment (:= modules, cca etc) with _x_ units, where _x_ denote the _time spent_ on it. (Can consider using _difficulty_ as a metric too, but the idea is to have a _single numerical evaluation_). For mods I have not done, I would ask people who have taken them for their perspectives. 

An example question can be:

```
Suppose the time spent on...
CS1101S/WCT/ST2131: 1.5 units
CS2030: 1.25 units
MA1101R/CS1231/CS2040/CS2100: 1 unit
CCA: 0.75 unit

How much time did you spend on CS3230?
```


- Estimate my capacity based on my performance for the past sems and the computed workload for the sem. 

From the example below, a good capacity estimate would be _4.5-4.75_.

| Sem         | Time Spent (in units) | CAP |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----|
| 1           | 5                     | 4   |
| 2           | 4.75                  | 4.5 |
| 3           | 4.5                   | 4.6 |
| 4 (current) | 4.75                  |     |


- If my current sem workload with mod _j_ is within the range of my estimated capacity from (2), then sure, let's add mod _j_ in.

All the best in your planning!
