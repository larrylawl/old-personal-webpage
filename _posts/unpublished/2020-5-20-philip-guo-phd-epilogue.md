I chanced upon this article on the [notes to cs freshman](https://github.com/nushackers/notes-to-cs-freshmen-from-the-future)
link, which I've found immensely helpful as I navigated college. Here are twenty lessons that Professor Philip learnt in his Ph.D. years. 

1. Results trump intentions
2. Outputs trump inputs
3. Find relevant information: My Ph.D. training has taught me how to effectively find the most relevant information for what I need to accomplish at each moment. Unlike traditional classroom learning, when I'm working on research, there are no textbooks, no lecture notes, and no instructors to provide definitive answers. 
4. **Create** lucky opportunities
5. Symbiotic relationships: By understanding the motivations and personalities of older Ph.D. students, professors, and other senior colleagues, I was able to lead my own initiatives even from the bottom of the pecking order.
6. Professors are human
7. Be well-liked
8. Pay some dues: It's necessary for junior lab members to pay their dues and be “good soldiers” rather than making presumptuous demands from day one.
9. Reject bad default projects
10. Know when to quit
11. Recover from failures
12. Ally with insiders
13. Give more talks: Discover common criticisms, improve public speaking skills, follow-up discussions that led to serendipity.
14. Sell, sell, sell
15. Generously provide help
16. Ask for help
17. Express true gratitude
18. Ideas beget ideas
19. Grind hard and smart
