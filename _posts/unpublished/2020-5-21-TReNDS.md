# TODO
# Brainstorming
## Optimisation Objective
MEDAL. (learning comes later)

## TODO:
- [ ] Understand how does RAPIDs know how long to train for? [IP]
- [ ] Removing site bias
- [ ] Use site classification to try and match val and test distribution. Effort is quite high, make sure it'll work.
- [ ] How to take advantage of correlation between variables and targets?
- [ ] Handle NAN values (in response at least)... imputation of everything doesn't seem to be working...

## EDA Insights
1. **Site Bias in IC_20.** Filter out shifts? 
2. For Source-based morphomotery loadings' correlation, there are strong correlations between age and some loading features that exceed -0.4.
    1. Linear correlation? 
3. KS-test to determine classify examples to site 1 and 2. From there, determine distribution of training and test sets. From here, I can further change my val set distribution to match the test set.
    1. Possibly change KS threshold to the formula I used, though I think it'll have limited effect.
4. Trying to mimick validation and test distribution.

Optimisation Objective: Medal
Purpose of blogging:
1. What I've Done (concretely shows what I've learnt)
2. What I've Learnt
3. How I can improve for the next competition

(No one cares about the specifics of the progress lol, people only care about the end product.)

Purpose:
1. Journal of progress?
2. Write down what I've learnt? - can't I just do this at the end?

Hey! This article serves to document my progress in my first Kaggle competition, TReNDS Neuroimaging: multiscanner normative age and assessments prediction with brain function, structure, and connectivity. You can view more details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/overview).

### 21052020 - First Submission

Submitted the baseline kernele kindly put together by ![Rohit Singh](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsingh9990). Model uses ridge and svm regression. **Baseline score is 0.162. Rank of 231/378**.
