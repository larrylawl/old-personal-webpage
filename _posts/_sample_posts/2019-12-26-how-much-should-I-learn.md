## Know what you are optimising for
## Learn knowledge which you will use.




So today I was telling my friend (De Xun) about my struggle to understand the proof for a machine learning algorithm, which required me to refresh my understanding of linear algebra. But he asked me this:

### Is the time spent learning the proof worth the while?

His point was that if I'm not going to use the proof again, chances are that I will forget about the proof entirely, which makes the time spent learning them wasted. As someone who loves learning from first principles, I often find myself forgetting these first principles, which makes De Xun's point pertinent. 


While I might not use the proof again, I will use the math needed to understand the proof regularly, thus it justifies the time spent. But...

### Why will I use the math regularly?

Firstly, I am **optimising to be a better practioner of machine learning.** In order to push the boundaries of the field, I need to do good research, which requires me to know my first principles, math, well.

> I learnt about the importance of optimisation from Chip Hu Yen [here](https://huyenchip.com/2018/10/08/career-advice-recent-cs-graduates.html)!

Secondly, **math is timeless.** The fact that math sustains the test of time implies two things:
1. My understanding of math stays with me forever, which makes the return in investment of it higher (unlike, say, frameworks which come and go so quickly)
2. The timeless nature underscores the importance of math.
> Thanks Varun for teaching me the importance of learning timeless skills!

But my optimisation to be a better practioner in machine learning begs another question.

### Why machine learning?
Because its **upwind**, which is defined by Paul Graham as "work(ing) on things that _interest you_ and _increase your options_, and worry later about which you'll take." 
>Paul Graham justifies the importance of upwind much better [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html) - highly recommended if you are figuring your career path in life just like me.

The fact that I love math, coupled with the prospects of machine learning, is the reason why I chose to craft my narrative in machine learning.

So yea, I will continue learning the proofs, for it improves my foundations in maths, which is important to my optimisation to be a better machine learning practitioner, which in turn keeps me upwind.

And its fun :).

### Takeaways
1. Knowing how much to learn saves time.
2. Only learn knowledge which you will use.
3. Know what you are optimising for.
4. Be upwind.

Thanks De Xun for the insightful advice :).
