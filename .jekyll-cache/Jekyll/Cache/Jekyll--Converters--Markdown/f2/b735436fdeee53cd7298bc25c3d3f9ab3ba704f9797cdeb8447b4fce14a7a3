<p>Recall that linear transformation is a function that moves a vector from its representation in its coefficient matrix to the standard basis.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Av = \lambda  v</script>

<p>If the linear transformation of this vector <em>v</em> <strong>retains its span</strong>, (ie a scalar transformation of the vector), then <em>v</em> is called an <em>eigenvector</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recall that span of a vector represents all possible linear combinations of a vector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This <strong>scalar transformation</strong>, $ \lambda $, is the <em>eigenvalue</em>.</p>

  <li>Linear transformation of the vector retains its span; its only a scalar transformation of the vector . These special vectors are called the eigenvector, and the factor by which it was stretched is called the eigenvalue. Matrix vector multiplication gives the same result as sclaing by some factor lambda.
