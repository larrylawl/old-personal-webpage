### Greetings World!

My name's Larry Law (or Law Ann Liat, Larry), and I'm a computer science junior with a minor in mathematics at the
[National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/), a scholar of the [University Scholar's Programme (USP)](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/) (a multidisciplinary academic programme wherein I learn to write and think critically) and a student at the [Turing Programme](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/tp/) (an invitation-based NUS research programme).

<!-- Prior experience (?) -->
For this summer, I will be researching on understanding multilingual embeddings with [DSO](https://www.dso.org.sg) under [Dr. Chieu Hai Leong](https://chaileon.github.io). Previously, I'm fortunate to have researched on **'Integrating Non-Myopic Bayesian Optimisation with Network Morphism for Neural Architecture Search'** under [A/P Low Kian Hsiang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html). 

My **resume** can be viewed [here](/assets/larry_resume.pdf).

<!-- ### Logs
Similar to how logging records events triggered by processes, this log serves to record milestones in my (professional) life.

```py
JAN_21 = "Accepted to the DSO internship programme!"

JAN_21 = "Accepted in the Turing programme!"

NOV_20 = "Completed my first research experience in autonomous robots! The journey was emotional but definitely the highlight of my sem. Thanks my good friend Yuan Bo for the collaboration!"

NOV_20 = "Halfway through UROP! Progress was surprisingly more productive in the semester than working on it full time in the summer, which I attribute to consistent communication with Prof Bryan. Thanks Wey Yeh for the collaboration so far!

MAR_20 = "Completed Dr Andrew's 14 weeks Deep Learning course. Was challenging juggling online courses and school work, but worth it as these courses allowed me to make a more informed decision for my UROP research project."

DEC_19 = "Completed Dr Andrew's 11 weeks Machine Learning course."

AUG_19 = "Completed Internship with AXA Singapore. Pretty fun front-end experience."
``` -->

### Why document my learning?

**To achieve mastery** - To me, the litmus test of one's mastery for a complex concept is the
ability to explain said concept simply.
By penning my learning down, I hope to have truly understood what I have learnt.

**To share knowledge** - I have always loved how developers helped each other so readily. These articles
are my humble way of contributing to this open-source culture;
I will be delighted if others found the articles helpful in their own pursuit of knowledge.

### Feedback

I'm always looking to improve. Any feedback is welcomed either via my socials, or directly in the comment section of my articles.
