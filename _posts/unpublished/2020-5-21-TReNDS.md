Optimisation Objective: Medal
Purpose of blogging:
1. What I've Learnt
2. How I can improve for the next competition

(No one cares about the specifics of the progress lol, people only care about the end product.)

Purpose:
1. Journal of progress?
2. Write down what I've learnt? - can't I just do this at the end?

Hey! This article serves to document my progress in my first Kaggle competition, TReNDS Neuroimaging: multiscanner normative age and assessments prediction with brain function, structure, and connectivity. You can view more details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/overview).
