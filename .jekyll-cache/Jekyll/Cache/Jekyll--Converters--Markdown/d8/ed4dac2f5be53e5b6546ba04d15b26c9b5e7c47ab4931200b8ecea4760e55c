<h2 id="intuition-for-linear-independence">Intuition for Linear Independence</h2>
<p>Consider the vectors</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\quad \vec{v}_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{c}{1} \\ {0} \\ {0}\end{array}\right) 
\quad \vec{v}_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{c}{0} \\ {1} \\ {0}\end{array}\right) 
\quad \vec{v}_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{c}{0} \\ {0} \\ {1}\end{array}\right)</script>

<p>Without $ v_1 $ which captures the x-axis, the linear combination of $ v_2 $ and $ v_3 $ can never express a vector in the x-axis (other than the origin). Likewise for $ v_2 $ (y-axis) and $ v_3 $ (z-axis).</p>

<p>Each vector in this example captures a unique <em>direction</em> that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-intuition-fits-the-definition">How the intuition fits the definition</h2>
<p>More formally, a set of vectors is defined as linearly independent if and only if <strong>for any vector in the set, it cannot be expressed as linear combination of the other vectors in the set.</strong></p>

<p>More concretely, this set of vectors are linearly independent if and only if <strong>the only scalars that satisfy the equation below are all zeros. (ie $ c_1 = c_2 = â€¦ = c_n = 0$)</strong></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_n][c_1,c_2, ..., c_n]^{\top} = 0</script>

<h2 id="how-to-determine-if-a-set-of-vectors-are-linearly-independent">How to determine if a set of vectors are linearly independent</h2>

<p>First, perform Gaussian Jordan Elimination to solve for the scalars (or matrix) c.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The scalars can be expressed as a matrix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the example below where there are no zero rows. Observe that from the 3rd equation, $ c_3 = 0 $. Thus $ c_2 = 0 $, and hence $ c_1 = 0 $. Since the only scalars that satisfy the equation are all zeroes, the set of vectors is linearly independent.

<p>Next consider the example below where there is a zero row. $ c_3 $ can take on any real value. Since there are non zero scalars that satisfy the equation, it is not linearly independent.

<p>More generally, <strong>the maximum number of linearly independent vectors is equal to the number of non-zero rows.</strong></p>
