<p>Recall that a linear transformation <em>moves</em> the vector. The determinant computes the <strong>factor by which the space was changed by this linear transformation</strong> (space := area in $ R_2 $, volume in $ R_3 $).</p>

<p>If the determinant, d, is…</p>

<p>( \R_{&gt; 0} $, d changes the space by a factor of d(</p>

<p>$ \R<em>{&lt; 0} $, d _flips</em> and changes the space by a factor of d.</p>

<p>$ {0} $, d squishes the space to one dimension. Thus the matrix is <em>non-invertible</em>, and hence it is <em>singular</em></p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-work">Why does this work?</h2>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">det(AB) = det(A)det(B)</script>

<p>AB is equivalent to</p>

<ol>
  <li>first applying linear transformation of B, which moves the vector from the representation of the column vectors of B to the standard basis. The factor by which this movement changes space is $ det(B) $.</li>
  <li>then applying linear transformation of A. The factor by which this movement changes space is $ det(A) $.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus determinant of the linear transformation of B then A equals the multiplication of the individual determinant values.</p>
